    ## Chef language
    Chef is stack-based esoteric programming language designed by David Morgan-Mar in 2002. Programs in Chef look like recipes,
    where variables are represented by ingredients and program's stacks are referred to as mixing bowls and baking dishes.

    Full specification of the language can be found on [David Morgan-Mar's webpage](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html) or
    on [Steffan Mueller's interpreter pages](http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/Acme-Chef/lib/Acme/Chef.pm).
