    <h3> Chef language </h3>
	<p> Chef is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language">stack-oriented</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">esoteric programming language</a> designed by David Morgan-Mar in 2002. Programs in Chef look like recipes, where variables are represented by ingredients and program's stacks are referred to as mixing bowls and baking dishes. Full specification of the language can be found on <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html">David Morgan-Mar's webpage </a> or on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/Acme-Chef/lib/Acme/Chef.pm">Steffan Mueller's interpreter pages</a>.

	<h3> Usage of the interpreter </h3>

	<p>Command line arguments
	<span class="marginnote"><img src="img/chef2.png" alt="Trace mode"/>In trace <em>(-t)</em> mode, the interpreter waits for user input after executing each line of code.</span>
<ul>
<li><b>-i &lt;file&gt;</b>: input file</li>
<li><b>-o &lt;file&gt;</b>: output file</li>
<li><b>-v</b>: show detailed information about recipes</li>
<li><b>-t</b>: interactive trace mode </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
 <b>Example</b>: <br>interpret file <i>myInput.chef</i> and write verbose output into file <i>output.txt</i></p>
 <code>chef -i myInput.chef -o output.txt -v</code>
